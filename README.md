# Kids Tutor

Project Description

The main aim of this mobile app is to educate nursery kids in a gaming methodology. The target audience of this app are kids of age 3 to 5 years who are all attending their nursery school. This app provides an easy way for kids to learn and write alphabets, numbers and other basics such as shape identification in an easy way. This app also provides a way to test their skills after completing their reading and writing practices which can be useful for both parents and teachers to assess their kids ability. This app provides reading, writing practice for alphabets and numbers to kids. Some of the existing app provides features for only reading the alphabets and numbers.
